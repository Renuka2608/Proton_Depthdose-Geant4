# Proton_Depthdose-Geant4
GEANT4 simulation of proton depth–dose distribution and Bragg peak behavior in a water phantom, with custom energy deposition scoring and dose profile analysis.
<br>
The simulation focuses on:

1.Geometry design and material definition (water phantom)

2.Physics list selection for hadronic and electromagnetic interactions

3.Custom energy deposition scoring along the beam axis

4.Statistical analysis of dose profiles

The objective is to develop foundational understanding of particle transport and energy deposition mechanisms relevant to proton beam applications.
